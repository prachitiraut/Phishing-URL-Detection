# Phishing-URL-Detection
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures. Typically, a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or organization. The message contains malicious software targeting the user's computer or has links to direct victims to malicious websites in order to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.  Task is to identify whether the given URL leads to phishing attacks or not.
